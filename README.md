# About the Project

Businesses rely on accurate sales forecasts to plan inventory, manage cash flow, prepare staffing, and avoid overstocking or losses.

This project builds a **Machine Learning-based Sales Forecasting System** that:

* Loads and cleans historical sales data
* Aggregates transactions into monthly summaries
* Engineers 15 time-based features (lag, rolling averages, seasonality)
* Trains and compares Linear Regression and Random Forest models
* Automatically selects the best model based on MAE
* Generates future sales forecasts for any number of months ahead
* Displays results in a business-friendly interactive web app

# How Forecasts Are Generated

## Step 1 — Monthly Aggregation

Raw transaction data is grouped by month, creating a cleaner time-series dataset.

## Step 2 — Feature Engineering

15 time-based features are generated.

| Feature Type     | Features                         |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Date Features    | Year, Month, Quarter, Season     |
| Lag Features     | Previous 1, 2, 3, and 12 months  |
| Rolling Features | 3, 6, and 12 month averages      |
| Flags            | Q4 Indicator, Year-End Indicator |

## Step 3 — Train/Test Split

The final 12 months are reserved as the test set to simulate future forecasting.

## Step 4 — Model Training

Two models are trained:

### Linear Regression

* Fast
* Explainable
* Captures long-term trends

### Random Forest

* Handles seasonality
* Captures non-linear patterns
* Often produces better accuracy

The model with the lowest MAE is automatically selected.

## Step 5 — Future Forecasting

Future sales are predicted recursively, where each prediction becomes part of the next month's feature set.

# Model Evaluation Metrics

| Metric   | Meaning                           |
| -------- | --------------------------------- |
| MAE      | Average prediction error          |
| RMSE     | Penalizes large prediction errors |
| R² Score | Measures explained variance       |
| MAPE     | Percentage forecasting error      |

### Rule of Thumb

* MAPE < 10% → Excellent
* MAPE < 20% → Good
* MAPE < 50% → Acceptable
* MAPE > 50% → Needs Improvement
